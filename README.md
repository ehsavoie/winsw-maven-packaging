[![Changelog](https://img.shields.io/github/release/jenkinsci/winsw-maven-packaging.svg?label=changelog)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/winsw-maven-packaging/releases/latest)

This repository represents the legacy packaging of [Windows Service Wrapper](https://github.com/winsw/winsw) as a Maven artifact
which is hosted in the [Jenkins Artifactory](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org).
New versions of the project use GitHub Releases and NuGet, but some Pipelines including Jenkins still use Maven as a download source.

New releases of the Maven packaging will be performed upon request.
